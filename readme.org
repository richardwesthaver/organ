#+DESCRIPTION: custom org-mode parser
#+AUTHOR: ellis

This is a modular tool for extracting information from emacs org-mode
files. It's highly opinionated and only suited for parsing my
documents. This means I may introduce syntax which is not supported by
or which can't be interpreted by Emacs Org-Mode. It also means that
/the complete Org-element API will not be supported/. The most
troublesome of org-mode features are simply ignored.

This project is driven by the idea that org-mode is pretty cool, but
that previous attempts to build a robust parser implementation have
been hindered by their attempts to clone the functionality as well.

My goals are as follows:
- org->sxp :: takes org-mode stream outputs SXP forms
- parallel :: take advantage of multi-threading to parse multiple
  trees simultaneously
- composable :: specialized methods for combining and composing
  org-mode nodes
